1️⃣ FREE vs PAID ACCESS MODEL (TRADIFY)

This model is designed to:

Build trust first

Avoid “scammy signal vibes”

Monetize analytics, discipline, and transparency

Scale later (signals, marketplace, advanced tools)

🎯 CORE PRINCIPLE (IMPORTANT)

❌ Do NOT lock basic visibility
❌ Do NOT hide users’ own data
❌ Do NOT force upgrades early

✅ Let users experience value
✅ Charge for depth, automation, and intelligence

🆓 FREE PLAN — “Trader Essentials”

Restrictions

❌ Limited history (30 days)

🔒 UPGRADE TRIGGERS (SMART & ETHICAL)

“More than 30 days history → Pro”

Always show value before asking for money.

2️⃣ LOGIN / SIGNUP UI DESIGN (COMMERCIAL, TRUST-BUILDING)

This is critical — first impressions decide conversions.

🧱 LAYOUT STRUCTURE
Split-Screen Layout (Best Choice)

Left (Brand / Trust)

TRADIFY logo

Tagline

Feature bullets

Subtle gradient / glow

Right (Form)

Login or Signup form

Clean, focused

No distractions

This is a proven SaaS pattern.

🚦 AUTH UX RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)

❌ No sidebar on login/signup

❌ No access to app routes without auth

✅ After login → redirect to Dashboard

✅ If session expires → redirect to login

✅ Show loading state on auth

🧭 ONBOARDING AFTER SIGNUP (POWERFUL)

After signup, show a 1-time onboarding flow:

Welcome message

“Connect your MT5”

Generate token

Download Python connector

Done → Dashboard

This reduces confusion and churn.

🤖 CHAT ASSISTANT IN LOGIN? (NO)

Chat assistant only inside the app

Not on login/signup

Keeps focus on conversion

🏁 FINAL PRODUCT VERDICT

With:

Free vs Paid done this way

Professional auth UI

Honest feature gating

TRADIFY becomes:

A serious trading SaaS — not a signal app.

This is the difference between:

Short-term users
and

Long-term paying traders
