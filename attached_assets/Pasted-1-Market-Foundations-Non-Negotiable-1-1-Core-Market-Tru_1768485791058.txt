1. Market Foundations (Non-Negotiable)
1.1 Core Market Truths

Price moves because of liquidity and order flow

Institutions accumulate → manipulate → distribute

Indicators lag; price is the source

Every trade must answer:

Who is trapped?

Where is liquidity?

Where is value?

2. Market Structure (The Backbone)
2.1 Structure Definitions

HH / HL → Uptrend

LL / LH → Downtrend

Range → Liquidity building

2.2 Break Types

BOS (Break of Structure)
→ Continuation signal

CHOCH (Change of Character)
→ Reversal warning

2.3 Structure Rules

HTF structure overrides everything

Never trade against HTF structure

LTF is for execution only

3. Supply & Demand (Institutional Zones)
3.1 Zone Types

RBR – Rally → Base → Rally (Demand)

DBD – Drop → Base → Drop (Supply)

RBD / DBR – Continuation zones

3.2 Valid Zone Criteria

Strong impulsive exit

Minimal basing

Fresh / untested

Breaks structure or creates imbalance

3.3 Zone Invalidation

Demand invalid → candle closes below

Supply invalid → candle closes above

Invalid zone = NO TRADE

4. Liquidity Theory (Smart Money Logic)
4.1 Liquidity Pools

Equal highs / equal lows

Trendline stops

Range highs & lows

Previous day high/low

Session highs/lows

4.2 Liquidity Rules

Price must take liquidity before real move

Liquidity grab ≠ reversal (needs confirmation)

Entries are taken after the sweep

5. Order Blocks (Institutional Footprints)
5.1 Definition

The last opposite candle before an impulsive move that breaks structure.

5.2 Valid OB Conditions

Leads to BOS / CHOCH

Clear imbalance

Untested

Located at premium/discount

5.3 Entry Logic

HTF OB → bias

LTF OB → execution

SL beyond OB extreme

6. Fair Value Gap (Imbalance)
6.1 Definition

A 3-candle imbalance where price moves too fast.

6.2 Rules

Price tends to rebalance

Best used with:

OB

Structure

Liquidity sweep

7. Fibonacci (Precision Tool)
7.1 Retracement Levels

23.6% → aggressive

38.2% – 50% → optimal

61.8% → last valid

61.8% → setup invalid (for continuation)

7.2 Fib Rules

Draw only after impulse

Confluence required (zone, OB, structure)

Never fib random swings

8. Price Action (Execution Confirmation)
8.1 Candle Psychology

Long wick → rejection

Large body → momentum

Small candles → absorption

8.2 Confirmation Types

Pin bar at level

Engulfing after sweep

Micro BOS on LTF

Failed breakdown / breakout
