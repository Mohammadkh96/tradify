1. Market Foundations (Non-Negotiable)
1.1 Core Market Truths

Price moves because of liquidity and order flow

Institutions accumulate → manipulate → distribute

Indicators lag; price is the source

Every trade must answer:

Who is trapped?

Where is liquidity?

Where is value?

2. Market Structure (The Backbone)
2.1 Structure Definitions

HH / HL → Uptrend

LL / LH → Downtrend

Range → Liquidity building

2.2 Break Types

BOS (Break of Structure)
→ Continuation signal

CHOCH (Change of Character)
→ Reversal warning

2.3 Structure Rules

HTF structure overrides everything

Never trade against HTF structure

LTF is for execution only

3. Supply & Demand (Institutional Zones)
3.1 Zone Types

RBR – Rally → Base → Rally (Demand)

DBD – Drop → Base → Drop (Supply)

RBD / DBR – Continuation zones

3.2 Valid Zone Criteria

Strong impulsive exit

Minimal basing

Fresh / untested

Breaks structure or creates imbalance

3.3 Zone Invalidation

Demand invalid → candle closes below

Supply invalid → candle closes above

Invalid zone = NO TRADE

4. Liquidity Theory (Smart Money Logic)
4.1 Liquidity Pools

Equal highs / equal lows

Trendline stops

Range highs & lows

Previous day high/low

Session highs/lows

4.2 Liquidity Rules

Price must take liquidity before real move

Liquidity grab ≠ reversal (needs confirmation)

Entries are taken after the sweep

5. Order Blocks (Institutional Footprints)
5.1 Definition

The last opposite candle before an impulsive move that breaks structure.

5.2 Valid OB Conditions

Leads to BOS / CHOCH

Clear imbalance

Untested

Located at premium/discount

5.3 Entry Logic

HTF OB → bias

LTF OB → execution

SL beyond OB extreme

6. Fair Value Gap (Imbalance)
6.1 Definition

A 3-candle imbalance where price moves too fast.

6.2 Rules

Price tends to rebalance

Best used with:

OB

Structure

Liquidity sweep

7. Fibonacci (Precision Tool)
7.1 Retracement Levels

23.6% → aggressive

38.2% – 50% → optimal

61.8% → last valid

61.8% → setup invalid (for continuation)

7.2 Fib Rules

Draw only after impulse

Confluence required (zone, OB, structure)

Never fib random swings

8. Price Action (Execution Confirmation)
8.1 Candle Psychology

Long wick → rejection

Large body → momentum

Small candles → absorption

8.2 Confirmation Types

Pin bar at level

Engulfing after sweep

Micro BOS on LTF

Failed breakdown / breakout

9. Chart Patterns (Secondary Confirmation)
7
9.1 Continuation

Bullish / Bearish Flag

Pennant

Rectangle

Ascending / Descending Triangle

9.2 Reversal

Double Top / Bottom

Head & Shoulders

Wedges

Rounding Top / Bottom

Patterns NEVER traded alone

10. Trade Types (When to Trade)
10.1 Continuation Trades

Requirements:

HTF trend intact

BOS printed

Pullback into demand/supply

LTF confirmation

10.2 Reversal Trades

Requirements:

HTF exhaustion

Liquidity sweep

CHOCH

New zone formed

11. Multi-Timeframe Model
Timeframe	Purpose
H4 / H1	Bias & zones
M15	Structure alignment
M5	Entry logic
M1	Precision execution

Rules:

Never skip a timeframe

LTF must agree with HTF

12. Risk Management (Survival Rules)
12.1 Risk

Fixed % per trade

SL always defined first

No SL movement without logic

12.2 R-Multiples

Minimum RR: 1:1.5

Partial at TP1

Trail after structure confirms

13. Trade Management
13.1 After Entry

Monitor structure

Watch invalidation

Respect session behavior

13.2 Exit Conditions

Zone invalidation

Structure break against trade

Target hit

Momentum failure

14. Forbidden Trades (Hard Rules)

Inside HTF opposing zone

Against HTF structure

Before liquidity sweep

Without confirmation

News volatility (optional filter)

15. Execution Checklist (Final Gate)

Before ANY trade:

HTF bias clear

Zone valid

Liquidity taken

Structure confirmed

Entry confirmed

RR acceptable

SL logical

If one fails → NO TRADE

16. Mindset Rules

No FOMO

No revenge trades

No over-trading

Process > outcome

Losses are data

17. Engine-Ready Logic (For Automation)

This knowledge translates directly into:

Bias Engine

Zone Validator

Liquidity Detector

Structure Engine

Entry Sensor

Trade Tracer

Invalidation Monitor
