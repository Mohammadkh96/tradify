1️⃣ Automatic MT5 Trade Capture

Goal: Eliminate all manual journaling and ensure complete, accurate trade data.

Profit/Loss

Handle:

Partial closes

Reliability Requirements

If sync fails:

Do not lose trades

Retry automatically

Show:

Last successful sync timestamp

UX Requirements

User never manually inputs trades.

User clearly sees that data is coming from MT5, not manual.
