✅ FINAL REPLIT PROMPT (NO AI, RULE-BASED)

Role:
You are a senior full-stack engineer and trading-system architect.
Build a professional rule-based trading analysis web app called MarketFoundations.

1️⃣ CORE PRINCIPLE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

❌ No AI decision making
❌ No indicators
❌ No guessing

✅ All analysis is done using predefined Market Knowledge rules
✅ The system evaluates conditions like a trading engine, not an AI model

2️⃣ APP PURPOSE

The app must:

Accept manual user inputs + chart screenshots

Apply hard-coded trading rules

Output:

Market bias

Structure state

Liquidity status

Valid / invalid trade setups

Return NO TRADE if rules are not fully met

3️⃣ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE (IMPORTANT)
UI (Dashboard / Journal / Upload)
        ↓
Chart Annotation Layer (manual or visual hints)
        ↓
Market Knowledge Rule Engine
        ↓
Decision Validator
        ↓
Structured Output (Trade / No Trade)


There is NO probabilistic AI anywhere.

4️⃣ MARKET KNOWLEDGE RULE ENGINE

Implement the following explicit modules:

A. Bias Engine (HTF)

Rules:

HH/HL → Bullish

LL/LH → Bearish

Inside HTF opposing zone → FORBIDDEN

B. Structure Engine

Detect:

BOS (continuation allowed)

CHOCH (reversal allowed only after confirmation)

Rules:

No BOS → No continuation trade

No CHOCH → No reversal trade

C. Liquidity Engine

Detect:

Equal highs / lows

Trendline liquidity

Range high / low sweeps

Rules:

Liquidity must be taken before entry

Sweep without confirmation = WAIT

D. Zone Validator

Zones:

Supply

Demand

Rules:

Candle close beyond zone = INVALID

Invalid zone = NO TRADE

E. Entry Validator (LTF)

Required:

Structure alignment

Rejection or engulfing

RR ≥ 1 : 1.5

5️⃣ SCREENSHOT HANDLING (IMPORTANT CLARITY)

Screenshots are used ONLY for:

Visual reference

Manual marking (zones, trendlines, swings)

Audit & review

❌ The system does NOT “interpret images”
✅ The trader marks structure/zones OR inputs confirmations via UI toggles

Example inputs:

HTF trend: Bullish

Liquidity taken: Yes

Zone valid: Yes

BOS confirmed: Yes

The engine validates logic — not the image itself.

6️⃣ UI SECTIONS (MATCH DESIGN)
Sidebar

Dashboard

Journal

New Entry

Knowledge Base

Risk Calculator

Dashboard

Win Rate

Total Trades

Profitable Trades

Avg R:R

Performance donut chart

Recent journal table

Pre-session reminder card

New Entry Page (CRITICAL)

User must input:

Pair

Timeframe

Trade type (Buy / Sell)

HTF bias

Structure state

Liquidity status

Zone validity

Entry / SL / TP

Screenshot upload

The system then:

Validates all rules

Either:

Accepts the trade

Rejects with exact rule violation

7️⃣ OUTPUT LOGIC (STRICT)

If ANY rule fails, return:

NO TRADE

Reason:
– HTF supply active
– No liquidity sweep
– Zone invalidated


If all pass:

VALID SETUP

Entry logic: Pullback to demand
Risk: 1R
Target: 2.5R

8️⃣ KNOWLEDGE BASE PAGE

Static, structured documentation:

Market Structure

Liquidity

Supply & Demand

Execution Rules

Forbidden Trades

Used as reference only, not AI prompts.

9️⃣ DATA MODEL (REQUIRED)

Store:

Trades

Rule outcomes

Violations

Screenshots

Journal history

Every trade must be auditable.

🔒 FINAL RULE

This app behaves like a disciplined senior trader:

No emotions

No assumptions

No forced trades

Rules first, always
