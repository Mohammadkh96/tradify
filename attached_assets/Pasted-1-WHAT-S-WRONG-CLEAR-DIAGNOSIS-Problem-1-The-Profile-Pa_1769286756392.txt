1️⃣ WHAT’S WRONG (CLEAR DIAGNOSIS)
❌ Problem 1: The Profile Page Is Trying to Do Too Much

Right now, the profile page mixes:

Identity (email, role)

System status

Subscription plan

Upgrade CTA

Developer unlock

MT5 status

Settings

This causes:

Visual clutter

No clear “main action”

Confusion about what the page is for

A profile page must feel calm and personal, not operational.

❌ Problem 2: No Clear Vertical Hierarchy

The user’s eyes don’t know where to start.

Issues:

Title is partially hidden by sidebar

“System Status” floats without context

Plan card competes with identity card

Commit button is floating without section clarity

A paid user expects:

“This is my account. I control it here.”

Right now it feels like a system dashboard.

❌ Problem 3: Sidebar + Content Padding Conflict

The content is too close to the sidebar.

Symptoms:

“PROFILE” header clipped visually

Left content feels squeezed

Right plan card feels detached

This is a layout container issue, not a component issue.

❌ Problem 4: Developer Unlock Should NOT Be Here

This is important.

Developer Unlock:

Is not a user feature

Is not profile-related

Breaks trust if visible to normal users

This should be:

Admin-only

Or behind a hidden flag

Or moved to Admin Console

2️⃣ WHAT A PROFESSIONAL PROFILE PAGE SHOULD FEEL LIKE

For a commercial SaaS, the profile page should feel:

Calm

Personal

Safe

Predictable

Focused on identity & security

Not:

Operational

Technical

Promotional-heavy

3️⃣ THE CORRECT PROFILE PAGE STRUCTURE (DO THIS)
✅ FIX THE LAYOUT FIRST (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Use a two-column grid with clear roles
[ LEFT COLUMN – User Settings ]   [ RIGHT COLUMN – Plan Summary ]


But with strict separation.

4️⃣ PROPOSED PROFILE PAGE (EXACT BLUEPRINT)
🔹 PAGE HEADER (FULL WIDTH)

Top of content area (not overlapping sidebar):

Profile
Subtitle: Manage your account, security, and preferences.

No system status here.

🔹 LEFT COLUMN (70%) — USER CONTROLS
SECTION 1: ACCOUNT IDENTITY (READ-ONLY)

Card title: Account

Fields:

Email (read-only)

Role (Trader)

Member since

This reassures users:

“This is my real account.”

SECTION 2: PERSONAL PREFERENCES (EDITABLE)

Card title: Preferences

Fields:

Display name

Timezone (dropdown)

Button:

Save changes

This gives users ownership.

SECTION 3: SECURITY (VERY IMPORTANT)

Card title: Security

Fields:

Current password

New password

Confirm new password

Button:

Update password

This MUST be here for a paid product.

SECTION 4: MT5 CONNECTION (REFERENCE ONLY)

Card title: MT5 Connection

Show:

Status (Connected / Offline)

Last sync time

Account number (masked)

Buttons:

Reset MT5 token

Reconnect MT5

No editing beyond that.

🔹 RIGHT COLUMN (30%) — PLAN & BILLING (SUMMARY ONLY)
SECTION 5: CURRENT PLAN (STICKY CARD)

Card title: Your Plan

Show:

Plan name (Free / Pro)

Billing cycle

Key limits (30-day history, etc.)

CTA:

Upgrade to Pro (if Free)

Manage subscription (if Pro)

This is the only promotional area on the page.

5️⃣ WHAT TO REMOVE OR MOVE (IMPORTANT)
❌ REMOVE FROM PROFILE PAGE

Developer Unlock

System Status badge

Anything admin-related

✅ MOVE TO:

Admin Console

Or top app header (system status)

6️⃣ SPACING & VISUAL FIXES (QUICK WINS)

Tell your dev to:

Increase left padding of main content (pl-8 or pl-10)

Ensure header does not sit under sidebar

Use consistent card widths

Align Commit / Save buttons inside cards, not floating

This alone will fix 60% of the visual issue.

7️⃣ WHY THIS MATTERS FOR PAID USERS

A paid user will judge your platform by:

“Can I manage my account easily?”

“Can I change my password?”

“Do I understand my plan?”

If the profile page feels messy:

They feel unsafe

They churn

They contact support

A clean profile page = lower churn, higher trust.
