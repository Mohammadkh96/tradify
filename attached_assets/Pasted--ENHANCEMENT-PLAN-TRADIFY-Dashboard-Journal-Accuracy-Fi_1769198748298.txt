🔧 ENHANCEMENT PLAN
TRADIFY – Dashboard & Journal (Accuracy-First)
1️⃣ FIRST RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

From this point forward:

✅ Balance, Equity, Floating P&L, Margin Level → MT5 source of truth

⚠️ All other metrics must be:

Clearly labeled as Derived from History

OR hidden until fully validated

OR computed only from confirmed MT5 history

❌ No silent assumptions
❌ No “looks right” numbers

2️⃣ DASHBOARD ENHANCEMENTS (PROFESSIONAL, TIERED)
A. Split the Dashboard into 3 Logical Layers

This instantly makes it feel more professional.

🔹 Layer 1: LIVE ACCOUNT STATE (MT5 – REAL TIME)

This section is already mostly correct — enhance clarity, not logic.

Cards (Top Row):

Balance (MT5)

Equity (MT5)

Floating P&L (MT5)

Margin Level % (MT5)

Enhancements:

Add small label: SOURCE: MT5 LIVE

Add “Last Sync: X sec ago”

Color margin level:

300% → Emerald

150–300% → Amber

<150% → Rose

👉 This tells traders: “These numbers are real.”

🔹 Layer 2: ACCOUNT HEALTH & RISK (MT5 + SIMPLE CALCS)

Add a compact Account Health panel:

Show:

Margin Used

Free Margin

Leverage

Open Risk (sum of floating exposure)

These are safe because they come directly from MT5 or trivial math.

🔹 Layer 3: PERFORMANCE ANALYTICS (HISTORY-BASED)

This is where professionalism matters.

Only compute metrics from:

Closed MT5 trades

Confirmed manual trades

Metrics to keep (but refine):

Win Rate → from closed trades only

Net P&L → closed trades only

Equity Curve → historical equity snapshots

Trade Count

Metrics to TEMPORARILY HIDE or LABEL:

Profit Factor

Expectancy

Avg R:R

Label them:

“Calculated from synced trade history”

If history is incomplete → show N/A

This honesty = trust.

3️⃣ EQUITY CURVE – MAKE IT PROFESSIONAL

Right now it’s visually fine but under-informative.

Enhance it by:

Dual line:

Equity

Balance

Tooltip on hover:

Date

Equity

Balance

Daily P&L

Time filters:

1D / 1W / 1M / All

If there’s only 1 data point:

Show “Waiting for historical snapshots…”

4️⃣ OPEN POSITIONS PANEL (CRITICAL FOR PRO TRADERS)

Your “Open Positions” card is empty — that’s a missed opportunity.

Replace it with a live table:

Columns:

Symbol

Direction (BUY/SELL)

Lot Size

Entry

Current Price

Floating P&L

SL / TP

Rules:

Data must come directly from MT5

If no open positions → show “No open positions”

This instantly upgrades the dashboard to terminal-level usefulness.

5️⃣ JOURNAL TAB – FROM LIST → ANALYSIS TOOL

Your journal already looks clean. Now make it functional.

A. Add Date Range Filtering (MANDATORY)

At the top of the journal:

From Date

To Date

Presets:

Today

This Week

This Month

Custom

Filtering must:

Query backend

Recalculate totals dynamically

B. Journal Summary (Filtered)

Above the trade list, show (for selected range):

Total trades

Wins / Losses

Net P&L

Win Rate

This makes the journal analytical, not just historical.

C. Trade Row Enhancements

Each trade row should show:

Left:

Symbol

Direction

MT5 ticket ID (small, muted)

Center:

Entry → Exit

Lot size

Duration

Right:

Result (Win/Loss/BE)

Net P&L (color-coded)

Badge:

MT5 SYNCED or MANUAL

6️⃣ DATA HONESTY (VERY IMPORTANT)

Because only some values are accurate right now:

Add Visual Truth Indicators

Green dot: “MT5 Verified”

Gray dot: “Derived”

Amber dot: “Pending sync”

Example:

Balance → 🟢 MT5

Win Rate → 🟡 Derived from history

Profit Factor → ⚪ Hidden until validated

This prevents false confidence, which kills trading platforms.

7️⃣ UX POLISH THAT MAKES IT FEEL PREMIUM

These are small but powerful:

Skeleton loaders instead of empty cards

Subtle pulse animation on live MT5 values

Tooltips explaining metrics

Sticky “MT5 LIVE” badge in header

Clear “Terminal Offline” state (you already have this — good)
