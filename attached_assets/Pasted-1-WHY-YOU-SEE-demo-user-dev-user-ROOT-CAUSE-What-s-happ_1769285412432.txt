1️⃣ WHY YOU SEE demo_user, dev-user (ROOT CAUSE)
What’s happening now

Your app likely:

Creates users without enforcing email as primary identity

Uses placeholders for development

Does not yet persist a real users table with verified emails

Admin console is reading from:

Mock data

Seed data

Or an incomplete auth payload

This is not a UI bug — it’s a missing identity layer.

✅ REQUIRED DECISION (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Email must be the primary user identifier everywhere.

Not:

username

demo_user

dev-user

But:

email (unique, verified)

Everything else hangs off that.

2️⃣ WHAT EVERY USER MUST HAVE (MINIMUM IDENTITY)

To be a real SaaS user, each account must have:

Core Identity

Email (unique)

Password (hashed)

Role (user, admin, owner)

Created date

Last login

Account State

Plan (free, pro, trial)

Subscription status

Trial end date (optional)

Profile (Editable by User)

Display name

Timezone

Preferred currency (optional)

Experience level (optional)

This enables:

Admin clarity

User trust

Support

Billing

Security

3️⃣ USER PROFILE TAB — REQUIRED & PROFESSIONAL

Yes — you absolutely need a Profile tab.
Every serious SaaS has one.

📍 WHERE IT LIVES

Sidebar (User only):

Dashboard
Journal
MT5 Bridge
Plans
Profile   ← NEW
Sign Out

🧑 PROFILE PAGE — STRUCTURE (BEST PRACTICE)
SECTION 1: ACCOUNT OVERVIEW (READ-ONLY)

Card: “Account”

Email (read-only)

Account role

Member since

Plan (Free / Pro)

Button:

“Manage Subscription” → Pricing / Billing

This reassures users:

“This is my real account.”

SECTION 2: PERSONAL PROFILE (EDITABLE)

Card: “Profile Information”

Display name

Timezone (dropdown)

Experience level (optional)

Button:

“Save changes”

This is about ownership & personalization.

SECTION 3: SECURITY (CRITICAL)

Card: “Security”

Change password

Current password

New password

Confirm new password

Button:

“Update password”

Optional (later):

Force logout all sessions

This removes support tickets immediately.

SECTION 4: SUBSCRIPTION (USER VIEW)

Card: “Subscription”

Current plan

Status (Active / Trial / Expired)

Next billing date (if Pro)

Buttons:

Upgrade to Pro

Cancel subscription (if paid)

This reduces churn anxiety.

SECTION 5: MT5 CONNECTION (REFERENCE)

Card: “MT5 Integration”

Connected / Offline

Account number (masked)

Last sync time

Buttons:

Reset MT5 token

Reconnect MT5

This gives users control.

4️⃣ HOW THIS FIXES THE ADMIN CONSOLE EMAIL ISSUE

Once you implement the Profile + Identity layer correctly:

Admin Console → Users Table will show:
Email	Role	Plan	MT5	Actions
user@email.com
	Trader	Free	Connected	Grant Pro

No more:

demo_user

dev-user

confusion

Because:

Users can only register with email

Email is stored, verified, and displayed

Admin reads from the real users table

5️⃣ REQUIRED DATABASE STRUCTURE (SIMPLE & CLEAN)

You do NOT need anything fancy.

users

id

email (unique)

password_hash

role

created_at

last_login

profiles

user_id

display_name

timezone

experience_level

subscriptions

user_id

plan

status

trial_end

provider_id (Stripe later)

This is enough for v1 production.

6️⃣ IMPORTANT UX RULES (DO NOT SKIP)

Email is never editable by user

Password change requires current password

Profile changes do not affect billing

Admin changes override user state

User cannot see admin-only fields

7️⃣ FINAL VERDICT (HONEST)

✅ Yes — a proper user identity & profile system

Is this normal at your stage?

✅ Completely

Will adding this:

Fix admin confusion? → YES

Increase user trust? → YES
