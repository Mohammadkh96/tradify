🤖 H. AI INSIGHTS MODULE (SAFE DESIGN)
PERFORMANCE & BEHAVIORAL INSIGHTS — DETAILED SPECIFICATION (For Replit)
🎯 Goal of the AI Insights Module

Increase user retention and value through clear performance understanding

Help users reflect and improve behavior

Never provide financial advice or trade recommendations

Operate strictly as a performance analyst, not a trader

✅ AI CAPABILITIES (ALLOWED)
1️⃣ Analyze Historical User Trades
Functional Requirements

AI receives aggregated historical trade data only, including:

Total trades

Win rate

Expectancy

R-multiple statistics

Drawdown

Session performance

Strategy-tagged performance

AI must not receive:

Live market data

Symbols to trade

Prices for future decisions

Broker credentials

Personally identifiable information (PII)

Output Expectations

AI describes what happened, not what to do next

Language must be descriptive and factual

2️⃣ Identify Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral Signals AI May Analyze

Overtrading frequency

Risk inconsistency

Performance degradation after X trades

Session-based performance differences

Strategy-specific outcomes

Example (Allowed)

“Trades taken after the third trade of the day show lower expectancy.”

Constraints

No moralizing language

No judgment

No urgency

3️⃣ Highlight Risk Inconsistency
Functional Requirements

AI compares:

Average risk per trade

Distribution of risk sizes

Outliers (over-risk trades)

AI explains patterns, not corrective actions

Example (Allowed)

“Your risk per trade varies significantly, which coincides with higher drawdowns.”

4️⃣ Summarize Weekly / Monthly Performance
Functional Requirements

AI generates summaries based on:

Defined timeframe (week / month)

Core metrics only

Summary must include:

Total trades

Net P&L

Expectancy

Best performing session

Most frequent rule violation

Tone

Neutral

Analytical

Concise

Example

“This week consisted of 42 trades with a net expectancy of +0.18R. Most losses occurred during the New York session.”

5️⃣ Compare Best vs Worst Conditions
Functional Requirements

AI compares:

Best vs worst session

Best vs worst strategy

Best vs worst time of day

Comparisons are historical only

Example (Allowed)

“Historically, your London session trades outperform Asia session trades in both win rate and expectancy.”

6️⃣ Ask Reflective Questions
Purpose

Encourage self-reflection without guidance.

Examples (Allowed)

“What changed in your execution during the New York session this week?”

“Were the higher-risk trades aligned with your original plan?”

Constraints

Questions only

No implied recommendations

⛔ AI RESTRICTIONS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The AI must never:

❌ Suggest trades

❌ Recommend buy/sell

❌ Provide entry, stop-loss, or take-profit

❌ Predict market direction

❌ Rank symbols or assets

❌ Encourage following other traders

❌ Compare users against other users

Any violation here is a hard failure.

7️⃣ Mandatory Disclaimer
Requirements

Every AI response must clearly display:

“This insight is for educational and analytical purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.”

Disclaimer must be:

Visible

Non-dismissable

Consistent across UI

8️⃣ AI Positioned as Assistant, Not Advisor
UX Requirements

Label AI clearly as:

“Performance Assistant”

or “Trading Performance Insights”

No “coach”, “mentor”, or “advisor” language

No authority tone

9️⃣ AI Responses Logged (Audit & Safety)
Functional Requirements

Every AI response must be logged with:

User ID

Timestamp

Input data summary (metadata only)

Output text

Logs stored securely

Logs accessible to admins (read-only)

Purpose

Compliance

Debugging

Abuse prevention

Prompt tuning

🔒 SECURITY & COST CONTROL

Rate-limit AI requests per user

Plan-based limits (Free vs Pro)

Fail gracefully if AI unavailable

Never block core dashboard if AI fails

🧪 EDGE CASE TESTING (MUST PASS)

⬜ AI unavailable → graceful fallback

⬜ AI output never contains advice

⬜ Disclaimer always present

⬜ Same input → consistent tone

⬜ No PII leakage

⬜ Logs created for every response

✅ DEFINITION OF “DONE” (ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA)

AI Insights Module is complete only if:

Insights are useful but safe

No advisory language exists

Users clearly understand AI’s role

Logs and limits are enforced

AI adds value without legal risk
