🔴 CURRENT REALITY (IMPORTANT)
What is happening now

The dashboard looks professional ✅

Metrics like Win Rate, Profit Factor, P&L are displayed ✅

BUT:

Equity is not live

Margin is not live

Open positions are not live

Trade history is not coming from MT5

There is no evidence of a real MT5 → App data pipeline

This means:

The MT5 connector is UI-only or partially stubbed.

There is no active Python process:

reading from the MT5 terminal

pulling account/position data

pushing it to your backend

So your intuition is correct:

“Shouldn’t MT5 have a Python app that syncs data?”
✅ Yes — absolutely. That is REQUIRED.

🧠 HOW THIS SHOULD ACTUALLY WORK (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

MT5 cannot magically sync with a web app on its own.

You need a local bridge.

The ONLY correct architecture is:
MT5 Terminal (running on user PC)
        ↓
Python Connector App (local process)
        ↓
Secure REST API (TRADIFY backend)
        ↓
Database
        ↓
Dashboard / Journal (read-only)


If the Python app is not running, then:

Equity = fake

P&L = fake

Dashboard = lying (even if unintentionally)

🔌 WHAT THE MT5 PYTHON CONNECTOR MUST DO

This is not optional. This is the foundation.

1️⃣ Python App (Local, Downloadable)

The user must:

Download a Python app (or packaged .exe)

Run it on the same machine as MT5

Paste a one-time token from TRADIFY

If this does not exist → NO MT5 SYNC EXISTS

2️⃣ Python Connector Responsibilities

Using the official MetaTrader5 Python package:

import MetaTrader5 as mt5


The connector must:

Connect to MT5
mt5.initialize()
account_info = mt5.account_info()

Pull LIVE data

Balance

Equity

Free margin

Margin used

Margin level

Leverage

Pull OPEN positions
positions = mt5.positions_get()


Including:

Symbol

Volume

Entry price

SL / TP

Floating P&L

Pull HISTORY
mt5.history_deals_get()


Including:

Closed trades

Profit

Commission

Swap

Time

3️⃣ Sync Loop (CRITICAL)

The Python app must run a loop:

while True:
    payload = collect_mt5_data()
    POST payload → /api/mt5/sync
    sleep(1–2 seconds)


MT5 is the single source of truth
The web app never recalculates equity or P&L

4️⃣ Backend Responsibilities

Your backend must:

Authenticate using the token

Store MT5 data per user

Reject stale or malformed payloads

Mark connection state:

CONNECTED

SYNCING

DISCONNECTED

If no payload received in X seconds → DISCONNECTED

5️⃣ Dashboard Rules (VERY IMPORTANT)

The dashboard must:

❌ NEVER show MT5 metrics if connector is offline
❌ NEVER guess equity
❌ NEVER “simulate” data

✅ Show:

“MT5 DISCONNECTED”

“Waiting for sync…”

If you don’t enforce this, users will never trust the platform.

🔍 WHY YOUR DASHBOARD LOOKS GOOD BUT IS WRONG

Right now:

Metrics exist

Charts exist

But they are not wired to MT5

This is the dangerous phase:

A platform that looks professional but is not truthful

You are right to stop here and question it.

✅ WHAT MUST BE DONE NEXT (IN ORDER)
Step 1 — STOP UI WORK

Do not add features.
Do not polish charts.

Step 2 — BUILD THE PYTHON MT5 CONNECTOR

This is the missing heart.

Without it:

MT5 Connection page is cosmetic

Dashboard is invalid

Journal is unreliable

Step 3 — ENFORCE HARD CONNECTION LOGIC

No Python sync → No MT5 data

No MT5 data → Dashboard locked

🔒 HARD TRUTH (BUT IMPORTANT)

You are building a business-grade trading platform.

A trader will forgive:

missing features

slow UI

They will never forgive wrong equity or P&L.

You are doing the right thing by stopping here.
