🗣 WHAT TO TELL REPLIT — AI

Implement the AI module strictly as a performance insights engine, not a trading assistant.

AI may only analyze historical, aggregated user data and provide descriptive insights.

Any form of trade recommendation, prediction, or instruction is explicitly forbidden.

Every AI response must:

Be labeled “Performance Insight”

End with “This is not financial advice”

Be logged for audit

AI must be rate-limited and gated by plan, and must never block core product functionality.
