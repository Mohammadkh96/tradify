AI analysis should NOT be a standalone “chatbot page”.

It should be:

Contextual

Embedded

Triggered by user data

Optional, not intrusive

AI is a layer on top of the product, not a feature users have to “visit”.

THE CORRECT PLACEMENT STRATEGY (FOUNDATION → PRO)
1️⃣ Primary Location: Dashboard Insights Panel (MOST IMPORTANT)
Where

Top or right side of the main dashboard

Near performance summary

What it shows

1–3 short AI insights

Based on:

Recent trades

Current week / month

Most obvious behavior pattern

Example UI

Performance Insight
“This week, your expectancy decreased after the third trade of each day. Historically, limiting daily trades correlates with lower drawdown.”

This is not financial advice.

Why this works

Users see value immediately

No extra navigation

Feels analytical, not promotional

2️⃣ Secondary Location: Weekly / Monthly Review Page
Where

Dedicated “Review” or “Insights” tab

Time-based (Week / Month)

What it shows

Structured AI summary:

Performance overview

Best / worst conditions

Discipline notes

Reflective questions

Why

Traders already review performance weekly/monthly

This is where deeper insight belongs

Feels professional and intentional

3️⃣ Contextual Micro-Insights (ADVANCED, OPTIONAL)
Where

Inside specific sections:

Journal

Session analytics

Strategy performance

Example

In Journal filter view:

“Trades filtered to NY session show lower expectancy compared to your average.”

Rule

Read-only

No popups

No interruptions

4️⃣ What NOT to Do (IMPORTANT)

❌ Do NOT create:

A “Chat with AI” page

A floating AI bubble

A trading assistant panel

A chatbot that waits for user prompts

These patterns:

Increase legal risk

Reduce seriousness

Encourage misuse

Break trust with your ICP

HOW USERS SHOULD EXPERIENCE AI (MENTAL MODEL)

AI should feel like:

“An analyst quietly reviewing my data and leaving notes.”

Not:

“A bot telling me what to do.”

This aligns perfectly with your serious, professional positioning.

VISUAL HIERARCHY (VERY IMPORTANT)
AI should be:

Smaller than charts

Less prominent than metrics

Clearly labeled

Clearly disclaiming

Metrics come first.
AI explains them second.

PERMISSION & CONTROL

Give users:

Ability to refresh insights

Ability to hide AI panel

Clear plan-based limits (Free vs Pro)

This reinforces trust.
