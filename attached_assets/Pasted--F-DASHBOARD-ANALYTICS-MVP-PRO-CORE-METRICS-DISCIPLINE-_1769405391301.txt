📊 F. DASHBOARD & ANALYTICS (MVP → PRO)
CORE METRICS, DISCIPLINE & BEHAVIOR — DETAILED SPECIFICATION (For Replit)
🎯 Goal of Dashboard & Analytics

Provide immediate, accurate performance clarity

Make mistakes visible and undeniable

Move users from “checking P&L” to improving execution

Ensure all calculations are deterministic and auditable

🧮 CORE METRICS

Support:

Positive R

Negative R

Display:

Average R

Distribution (optional later)
