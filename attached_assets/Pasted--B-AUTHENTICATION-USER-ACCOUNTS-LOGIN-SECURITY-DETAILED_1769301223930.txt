🔐 B. AUTHENTICATION & USER ACCOUNTS
LOGIN & SECURITY — DETAILED SPECIFICATION (For Replit)
🎯 Goal of Login & Security

Ensure reliable access control

Prevent unauthorized dashboard access

Maintain session stability across refreshes

Eliminate routing inconsistencies

Make auth behavior predictable and auditable

1️⃣ Login Works Consistently
Functional Requirements

Users log in using:

Email

Password

Credentials validated securely against hashed password

Login must:

Work across refreshes

Work across browser tabs

Work after short inactivity

UX Requirements

Clear error messages:

Invalid email or password

No silent failures

Login button disabled during submission

Loading state shown

2️⃣ Session Persistence
Functional Requirements

Auth session must persist:

Page refresh

Browser reopen (if allowed)

Use secure authentication method:

HttpOnly cookies or secure tokens

Session expiration defined (e.g., idle timeout)

UX Requirements

User should not be logged out unexpectedly

If session expires:

Redirect to login

Show reason (“Session expired”)

3️⃣ Logout Works Correctly
Functional Requirements

Logout:

Invalidates session/token immediately

Clears auth state client-side

After logout:

User cannot access protected routes

Back button does not restore session

UX Requirements

Clear confirmation of logout

Redirect to public landing or login page

No cached protected content visible

4️⃣ Protected Routes Enforced
Functional Requirements

All dashboard and admin pages must:

Require valid authentication

If unauthenticated user attempts access:

Redirect to login

Preserve intended destination (optional)

Security Requirements

Route protection enforced server-side, not only frontend

API endpoints must validate authentication

Admin routes require admin role

5️⃣ Public Routes Accessible Without Authentication
Public Pages

Landing page

Pricing

Login

Registration

Legal pages (Terms, Privacy)

Requirements

Public routes must:

Never redirect to dashboard automatically

Load without auth checks

Authenticated users may be redirected intentionally (e.g., from login → dashboard)

🔒 Security Hardening (Minimum Standard)

Passwords never logged

Tokens never exposed to client JS if avoidable

CSRF protection (if cookies used)

Rate-limit login attempts

Prevent brute force attacks

Secure cookie flags enabled (Secure, SameSite)

🧪 Edge Case Testing (Must Pass)

⬜ Refresh dashboard → still logged in

⬜ Logout → dashboard access blocked

⬜ Direct URL to dashboard while logged out → redirected

⬜ Login failure → no partial session created

⬜ Admin routes blocked for non-admin users

✅ Definition of “DONE” (Acceptance Criteria)

Login & security are complete only if:

Auth works reliably across sessions

No unauthorized access possible

Routing behaves predictably

No accidental redirects

Admin and user roles are enforced correctly
