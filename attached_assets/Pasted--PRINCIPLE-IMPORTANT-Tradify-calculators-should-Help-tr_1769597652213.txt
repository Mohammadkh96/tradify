🎯 PRINCIPLE (IMPORTANT)

Tradify calculators should:

Help traders quantify risk, discipline, and exposure

Never suggest entries or direction

Be deterministic and explainable

Integrate naturally with Strategies & Compliance

✅ CORE CALCULATORS YOU SHOULD BUILD (V1)

These are non-negotiable. Every serious trader uses them.

1️⃣ Position Size Calculator (You already have it) ✅

Purpose:
Calculate lot size based on risk.

Inputs

Account balance

Risk %

Stop loss (pips / points)

(Later: symbol, pip value auto-detect)

Outputs

Risk amount

Position size (lots)

📌 This is foundational — keep it simple and accurate.

2️⃣ Risk–Reward (R:R) Calculator

Purpose:
Help traders understand expectancy before execution.

Inputs

Entry price

Stop loss

Take profit

Outputs

Risk (points / $)

Reward (points / $)

R:R ratio

Why it fits Tradify

Encourages discipline

Connects directly to strategy rules (e.g. RR ≥ 1.5)

3️⃣ Trade Outcome Calculator (P&L Simulator)

Purpose:
Answer: “If I take this trade, what happens?”

Inputs

Position size

Entry price

Exit price

Outputs

Profit / loss

% of account gained / lost

📌 No direction advice — just math.

4️⃣ Drawdown Calculator (VERY IMPORTANT)

Purpose:
Show traders how damaging losses compound.

Inputs

Account balance

Drawdown %

Outputs

Remaining balance

% gain required to recover

Example Insight

“A 20% drawdown requires a 25% gain to recover.”

This is one of the most powerful discipline tools you can add.

5️⃣ Risk of Ruin Calculator (Simplified)

Purpose:
Quantify long-term survival.

Inputs

Win rate

Risk per trade

Number of trades

Outputs

Probability of ruin (approximate)

Survival likelihood

📌 Keep it educational, not predictive.

⭐ STRATEGY-CONNECTED CALCULATORS (HIGH VALUE)

These directly connect calculators to your Strategy system.

6️⃣ Strategy Risk Profile Calculator

Purpose:
Evaluate whether a strategy is structurally survivable.

Inputs

Risk per trade

Max trades per day

Expected RR

Historical win rate (optional)

Outputs

Expected drawdown range

Capital volatility estimate

This reinforces:

“Good strategy ≠ good discipline if risk is wrong.”

7️⃣ Rule Violation Cost Calculator (VERY UNIQUE)

Purpose:
Show the cost of breaking rules.

Inputs

Average loss

Number of violations per month

Outputs

Monthly discipline cost

Annual cost projection

Example:

“Breaking your max risk rule 4 times/month costs ~$1,200/year.”

This aligns perfectly with Tradify’s mission.

🧠 EDUCATIONAL / OPTIONAL CALCULATORS (V2)

Build later — not required for MVP.

8️⃣ Compounding Calculator

Growth over time

Reinforces patience

9️⃣ Session Performance Calculator

Session-based expectancy

Pulls from journal data

❌ CALCULATORS YOU SHOULD NOT ADD

Avoid these — they dilute trust.

❌ “Best lot size”
❌ “Optimal leverage”
❌ “What should I risk?”
❌ Signal-like calculators
❌ Indicator-based calculators

Anything that decides for the trader is off-brand.

One job only

🔗 HOW CALCULATORS SHOULD INTEGRATE WITH STRATEGIES

This is key.

Examples:

Strategy rule: Max Risk ≤ 1%
→ Calculator highlights when risk exceeds rule

Strategy rule: RR ≥ 2
→ RR calculator flags non-compliant setups

📌 Calculators support decisions, they don’t enforce them.

🧠 FINAL RECOMMENDATION (CLEAR)
Build in this order:

Position Size

Risk–Reward

Drawdown

Trade Outcome

Rule Violation Cost

That alone makes Tradify more professional than 90% of platforms.
