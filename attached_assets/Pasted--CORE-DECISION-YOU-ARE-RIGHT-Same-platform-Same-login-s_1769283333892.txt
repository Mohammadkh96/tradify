✅ CORE DECISION (YOU ARE RIGHT)

✔️ Same platform
✔️ Same login system
✔️ Different dashboard, different tabs, different layout for admin

This is the correct SaaS pattern.

🧠 ROLE-BASED ENTRY FLOW (CRITICAL)
On login:
IF role === "user"   → /app/dashboard
IF role === "admin"  → /admin/overview


Admins never land on the user dashboard

Users never see admin UI

No toggles, no switching modes

This avoids mistakes and confusion.

🧱 ADMIN CONSOLE – WHAT IT SHOULD ACTUALLY HAVE

Think of the Admin Console as Operations + Control, not analytics.

1️⃣ ADMIN OVERVIEW DASHBOARD (LANDING PAGE)

This replaces what you currently have.

Purpose:

Give you a 30-second overview of the business & system health.

Cards to show:
📊 Business

Total Users

Active Users (last 24h / 7d)

Free vs Pro count

Trials active

💳 Subscriptions

Active Pro subscriptions

Canceled this month

Trial → Pro conversions (later)

🔌 MT5 System

MT5 connectors online

MT5 connectors offline

Failed syncs (last 24h)

🟢 System Health

API status

Database status

Worker / sync status

This page answers:

“Is the business and system healthy right now?”

2️⃣ USERS MANAGEMENT (MOST IMPORTANT TAB)

This is the heart of your admin console.

/admin/users
Table Columns:

Email

Role (User / Admin)

Plan (Free / Pro / Trial)

MT5 Status (Connected / Offline)

Registered

Last Active

Actions (View)

3️⃣ USER DETAIL VIEW (CLICK INTO USER)
/admin/users/:id

This page is non-negotiable.

🧑 User Info

Email

Role

Signup date

Last login

IP / region (optional)

💳 Subscription

Plan

Status

Trial end date

Billing ID (Stripe later)

🔌 MT5

Connected? (Yes / No)

Last sync time

Account number (masked)

Reset MT5 token (button)

🎛 Admin Actions (CRITICAL)

Promote to Pro

Downgrade to Free

Grant trial (7 / 14 / 30 days)

Suspend / Ban user

Add internal note

This is how you handle support, promos, beta users.

4️⃣ SUBSCRIPTIONS / PLANS TAB
/admin/subscriptions

Purpose:
See who is paying and who is not.

Show:

Active Pro users

Trials

Expired

Revenue summary (later)

Controls:

Manually assign plan

Extend trial

Cancel subscription

5️⃣ MT5 MONITORING TAB (VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOU)
/admin/mt5

This is unique to your product.

Show:

Connected MT5 instances

Offline instances

Last heartbeat time

Sync errors

This lets you:

Detect issues early

Support users faster

Maintain trust

6️⃣ AUDIT LOGS (PROTECTION FOR YOU)
/admin/audit-logs

Log every admin action:

Who did it

What action

Which user

Timestamp

Example:

admin@tradify.io → Promoted user@email.com to Pro

This protects you legally and operationally.

7️⃣ ADMIN SIDEBAR (SEPARATE FROM USER SIDEBAR)

Admins should see this, not the trading UI.

Admin Sidebar Tabs:

Overview

Users

Subscriptions

MT5 Monitor

Audit Logs

System Settings (later)

Sign Out

Users will never see this sidebar.

🚫 WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT PUT IN ADMIN

❌ Charts about trading performance
❌ User trading history (unless for support)
❌ Signals / Traders Hub
❌ Anything market-related

Admin = operations, not trading.

🎯 WHY THIS STRUCTURE IS GOOD

This admin console allows you to:

Operate subscriptions

Support users

Run promotions

Handle beta testers

Monitor MT5 health

Scale professionally

Without:

Overengineering

CRM bloat

Unnecessary complexity

🏁 FINAL VERDICT (VERY CLEAR)

Your instinct is 100% correct.

What you should do:

Keep same platform

Use role-based routing

Give admins a different dashboard, tabs, and layout

Never mix user & admin experiences

This is how real SaaS products are built.
