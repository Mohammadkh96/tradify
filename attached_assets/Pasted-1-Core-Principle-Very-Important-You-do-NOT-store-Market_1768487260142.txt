1️⃣ Core Principle (Very Important)

You do NOT store Market Knowledge as text or explanations.

You store it as structured rule systems that the app can:

Validate

Fail

Pass

Explain

Think like this:

❌ “Bullish flag is continuation”
✅ “IF structure = bullish AND consolidation = valid AND breakout = BOS → continuation allowed”

2️⃣ How Market Knowledge Must Be Represented

You split Market Knowledge into 5 layers, not one big document.

Market Knowledge
│
├── Definitions (what things are)
├── Detection Rules (how to recognize them)
├── Validation Rules (when they are valid)
├── Execution Rules (when to trade)
└── Invalidation Rules (when to reject)


This is how professional trading engines are built.

3️⃣ Layer 1: DEFINITIONS (Static Knowledge)

This is your Knowledge Base page.

Example structure (human-readable):

Market Structure

HH = higher high

HL = higher low

BOS = break of structure

CHOCH = change of character

Liquidity

Equal highs

Equal lows

Trendline liquidity

Range liquidity

Zones

Supply

Demand

Order blocks

⚠️ These are reference only, not executable.

4️⃣ Layer 2: DETECTION RULES (Inputs)

Since you are not using AI, detection is done via:

User inputs

Checkboxes

Dropdowns

Toggles

Numeric fields

Example (New Entry form):

HTF Trend:
[ ] Bullish
[ ] Bearish
[ ] Range

Structure:
[ ] BOS
[ ] CHOCH
[ ] None

Liquidity Taken:
[ ] Equal Highs
[ ] Equal Lows
[ ] Trendline
[ ] None


The app does NOT guess.
The trader declares facts.
The engine judges them.

5️⃣ Layer 3: VALIDATION RULES (The Brain)

This is where Market Knowledge becomes logic.

Each strategy, pattern, or setup is expressed as a rule set.

Example: Bullish Continuation Setup
setup_name: Bullish Continuation

requirements:
  htf_trend: bullish
  structure: BOS
  liquidity_taken: true
  zone_type: demand
  zone_status: valid

forbidden:
  inside_htf_supply: true
  zone_invalidated: true

execution:
  entry: demand_retest
  sl: below_demand
  min_rr: 1.5


If any requirement fails → NO TRADE.

6️⃣ Layer 4: STRATEGIES (Composed Logic)

A strategy is just a collection of rule sets.

Strategy = Collection of Valid Setups

Example:

Strategy: Trend Continuation

Bullish Flag

Bearish Flag

Pullback to Demand

Breakout–Retest

Each setup has:

Conditions

Allowed context

Forbidden context

7️⃣ Layer 5: PATTERNS (Secondary Filters)

Patterns are never standalone.

They act as confidence enhancers.

Example: Bullish Flag
pattern_name: Bullish Flag

valid_if:
  trend: bullish
  impulse_present: true
  consolidation_depth: shallow
  volume: decreasing

invalid_if:
  structure: CHOCH
  liquidity_against_trend: true


Pattern alone = ❌
Pattern + structure + liquidity = ✅

8️⃣ Invalidation Rules (Most Important)

Every Market Knowledge item must have an invalidation condition.

Examples:

Demand invalid → candle closes below

Supply invalid → candle closes above

Continuation invalid → CHOCH appears

Reversal invalid → no liquidity sweep

These rules are checked continuously.

9️⃣ Rule Evaluation Engine (How App Thinks)

When user submits a trade:

1. Load HTF rules
2. Validate forbidden conditions
3. Validate required conditions
4. Match against known setups
5. Calculate RR
6. Return:
   - VALID SETUP
   - or NO TRADE + reasons


Important:

The app must list which rule failed

No vague rejections

🔟 How You Store ALL Market Knowledge

You store it as:

Structured configs (JSON / YAML)

Modular rule files

Versioned strategies

Example structure:

market_knowledge/
├── definitions/
├── structure_rules/
├── liquidity_rules/
├── zone_rules/
├── patterns/
├── strategies/
└── invalidation_rules/


This makes the app:

Maintainable

Expandable

Auditable

11️⃣ Why This Solves Your Problem

You can encode everything you know

Nothing is forgotten

No interpretation errors

No AI hallucinations

Exact same logic every time

This is how institutional-grade systems are built.

12️⃣ Next Logical Step (Choose One)

1️⃣ Convert your entire Market Knowledge into rule tables
2️⃣ Design the New Entry form → rule mapping
3️⃣ Build a strategy–pattern–rule matrix
4️⃣ Create ready-to-import JSON/YAML files
5️⃣ Write the backend rule evaluation engine

Tell me which one you want next, and I’ll do it cleanly.

Convert your entire Market Knowledge into rule tables with strategies patterns info a tought this project

Below is a full conversion of the entire Market Knowledge you taught in this project into clear, deterministic RULE TABLES.

This is engine-ready knowledge — not theory, not explanation, not AI language.

You can store this as database tables, JSON/YAML, or backend configs.

MARKET KNOWLEDGE – MASTER RULE TABLES
