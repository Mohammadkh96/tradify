Light mode was added, but it is partial and inconsistent.
Some components, cards, text, and UI states still rely on hardcoded dark colors, so they do not respond to theme changes.

This means:

Theme switching is not centralized

Components are not theme-aware

Styles are leaking from dark-mode assumptions

✅ REQUIRED FIX: PROPER THEME SYSTEM (NOT PATCHES)
1️⃣ Single Source of Truth for Theme
Requirement

Introduce a global theme state (light | dark)

Theme must be accessible by:

Layout

Pages

Components

Cards

Buttons

Text

Borders

Icons

❌ Do NOT:

Toggle classes randomly

Override styles inline

Hardcode colors per component

2️⃣ Replace Hardcoded Colors with Theme Tokens
Problem seen in screenshot

Cards still use:

Dark gradients

Dark text colors

Dark border shadows

Text opacity tuned for dark backgrounds

Required action

Define design tokens instead of raw colors.

Example (conceptual, not code):

bg-primary

bg-surface

text-primary

text-secondary

border-default

accent-success

Each token must have:

Light value

Dark value

3️⃣ Card & Pricing Components (Explicitly Broken)
Required fixes

Pricing cards must:

Switch background color

Switch text contrast

Switch border visibility

Remove dark gradients in light mode

“Recommended” badge must:

Adapt color contrast

Not assume dark background

Explicit instruction

No pricing card may define its own colors directly.

4️⃣ Text Contrast & Accessibility
Issues

Some text is:

Too light on light background

Using opacity meant for dark mode

Required fixes

All text must reference theme tokens

No opacity hacks for readability

Minimum contrast standards enforced

5️⃣ Buttons & CTAs
Required fixes

Primary CTA buttons:

Must adapt background + text color

Hover states must be theme-aware

Secondary buttons:

Borders and text must adapt

6️⃣ Shadows & Depth (Often Missed)

Dark mode shadows ≠ light mode shadows.

Required fixes

Define:

shadow-card-light

shadow-card-dark

Light mode:

Softer, lighter shadows

Dark mode:

Subtle glow or deep shadow

7️⃣ Icons, Dividers, and Badges
Required fixes

Icons must inherit text color

Dividers must adapt opacity per theme

Status badges must define light/dark variants

8️⃣ Theme Enforcement Rule (IMPORTANT)

Add a rule:

Any new component must use theme tokens only.
Hardcoded colors are forbidden.

This prevents regression.

🧱 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (WHAT “DONE” MEANS)

Replit must confirm:

 Switching theme updates 100% of UI

 No hardcoded dark colors remain

 All cards readable in light mode

 No text relies on opacity hacks

 Pricing section looks intentional in both modes

 No visual regressions when toggling
