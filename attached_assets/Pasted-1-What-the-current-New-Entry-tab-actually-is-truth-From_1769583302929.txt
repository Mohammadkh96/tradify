1️⃣ What the current “New Entry” tab actually is (truth)

From the screenshot, New Entry is NOT an entry tool.

It is:

A rule evaluation engine

A pre-trade validation framework

A compliance checker

It does not:

Place trades

Suggest trades

Recommend entries

So calling it “New Entry” is misleading — both technically and psychologically.

2️⃣ What it SHOULD be called: Strategies

Renaming New Entry → Strategies is the correct move.

Because what the trader is actually doing there is:

“Define the rules I believe in, and check whether a potential trade aligns with them.”

That is a strategy builder, not an entry form.

3️⃣ What “Strategies” should mean in Tradify (very important)
A Strategy in Tradify =

A user-defined rule framework that the trader voluntarily follows.

Not:

AI rules

Platform rules

Generic education rules

But:

The trader’s own logic, explicitly defined

4️⃣ Correct mental model (this will guide everything)
❌ Wrong mental model

“Tradify tells me when to trade.”

✅ Correct mental model

“I define how I trade. Tradify checks whether I am respecting that.”

This keeps Tradify:

Non-advisory

Non-signal

High-trust

Institutional in mindset

5️⃣ How the “Strategies” tab should be structured
1️⃣ Strategy Builder (core)

The trader can:

Create a strategy

Name it

Define rules

Save it

Example:

Strategy Name: London Liquidity Sweep Reversal

2️⃣ Rule Categories (what you already have)

You are already very close — just reframe them.

🔹 Market Context Rules (Detection Rules)

HTF Bias (Bullish / Bearish / Range)

Liquidity status (Taken / Pending)

Structure state (BOS / CHOCH)

Zone validity (Valid / Invalid)

These are context rules, not signals.

🔹 Execution Rules (Non-Negotiables)

HTF bias confirmed

Price in valid S/D zone

Liquidity swept prior to entry

LTF structure shift confirmed

Entry model printed

These are self-imposed execution constraints.

3️⃣ Strategy Evaluation Output (already correct)

The right-side panel is excellent, conceptually.

It should say:

✅ Strategy compliant

❌ Strategy violated

List which rules failed

Not:

“No Trade” (sounds advisory)

Instead:

Strategy Not Aligned

This wording matters a lot.

6️⃣ How this connects to Rule Compliance Score (cleanly)

This is where everything clicks.

Flow:

Trader defines Strategy A

Trader takes real trades (MT5 / manual)

Each trade is evaluated after the fact:

Did it comply with Strategy A?

Rule Compliance Score is calculated:

Last 10 trades

% aligned

Violations count

Improvement trend

Now:

Strategy Builder → Intent

Journal → Reality

Compliance Score → Discipline

This is a beautiful, coherent loop.

7️⃣ Very important: What AI’s role is here (guardrails)
AI must NOT:

Define strategies

Decide rules

Override user rules

Suggest entries

AI CAN:

Explain violations

Detect patterns in non-compliance

Summarize behavioral drift

Example:

“Most violations occurred after consecutive losses, with increased risk size.”

AI = explanation layer, not authority.

8️⃣ What to rename (concrete recommendations)
Current	Change to
New Entry	Strategies
No Trade	Strategy Not Aligned
Entry Confirmation	Execution Confirmation
Detection Rules	Market Context Rules
Execution Checklist	Execution Rules

These are semantic fixes that massively improve clarity.

9️⃣ Should traders “follow” the strategy?

Yes — but voluntarily.

The platform should never say:

“You must do this”

Instead:

“This trade does / does not align with the strategy you defined.”

This keeps responsibility with the trader, which is crucial.

10️⃣ Final answer (very clear)

✅ Yes — you should change New Entry → Strategies
✅ Yes — the trader builds their own strategy
✅ Yes — the platform evaluates alignment, not entries
❌ No — the platform must not give trade advice

You’re not just renaming a tab — you’re fixing the product’s conceptual spine.
